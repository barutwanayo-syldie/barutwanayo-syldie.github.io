      <title>Agriculture in Russia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Agriculture in Russia survived a severe transition decline in the early 1990s as it struggled to transform from a command economy to a market-oriented system.[1] Following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, large collective and state farms – the backbone of Soviet agriculture – had to contend with the sudden loss of state-guaranteed marketing and supply channels and a changing legal environment that created pressure for reorganization and restructuring. In less than ten years, livestock inventories declined by half, pulling down demand for feed grains, and the area planted to grains dropped by 25%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of mineral fertilizer and other purchased inputs plummeted, driving yields down. Most farms could no longer afford to purchase new machinery and other capital investments. Following a nearly ten-year period of decline, Russian agriculture has experienced gradual ongoing improvement. The transition to a more market-oriented system has introduced an element of fiscal responsibility, which has resulted in increased efficiency as farmers try to maintain productivity while adjusting the resource constraints. The relatively smaller corporate farms and family farms that have emerged and grown stronger in the new market environment are now producing in aggregate value more than the total output of large corporate farms that first succeeded the traditional collectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2014 devaluation of the rouble and imposition of sanctions spurred domestic production, and in 2016 Russia exceeded Soviet grain production levels, and in that year became the world&amp;rsquo;s largest exporter of wheat.[2] In the last years Russia has emerged as a big agricultural power again,[3][4] despite also facing various challenges.[4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geopolitical analyses of climate change adaptation foresee large opportunities for Russian agriculture during the rest of the 21st century as Siberia&amp;rsquo;s arability increases.[5] Managing migration flows, internal and international, is expected to be a central aspect of the process.[5]&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What to see and what to do in Burundi</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What to see and what to do in Burundi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the situation in Burundi&amp;rsquo;s neighboring countries remains precarious, the landlocked country has magnificent monuments that retrace its history since the mid-18th century. The Gitega Museum, created in 1955, is the guardian of Burundi&amp;rsquo;s past. Specimens of gourds, tools and objects used for daily work are present in this museum. It also keeps photographs of the last monarchs of the country as well as some traces left by colonization. It is an ethnological and photographic museum. The second museum is located in the capital Bujumbura, it is a living museum with reconstructions of royal huts. A herpetological research center is also stored there, a reptile reserve built within it has been growing since its opening in 1988.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other monuments also attract the curious, the Belvedere of Bujumbura, for example, houses the mausoleum of Prince Louis Rwagasore, the main actor of national awareness. 10 km south of the capital, a stone was erected to recall the meeting of the scientist Livingstone and the young reporter Stanley in 1871. Various national parks make Burundi&amp;rsquo;s popularity worldwide, such as the Kibira Park and the Ruvubu Park. These parks allow not only to observe the animals of the African bush but in particular to evolve among them. The Kibira park even offers swimming in its thermal springs to be more in touch with nature. The fauna observed can range from antelopes to crocodiles, baboons and chimpanzees. Other monuments are just as amazing a few hours away from Bujumbura. The pyramid of Rotovu, for example, is built on the southernmost source of the Nile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open faults of Nyakazu as well as the Karera Falls, the second most important falls after those of Victoria, also offer a spectacle difficult to forget. Lake Tanganika is not to be omitted, classified as the most fishy lake in the world, its views from Vyanda are dazzling. Although the monuments are admirable, the popular heat will remain the best image of Burundi. A warm and friendly people who live to the rhythm of Ingomas with the drummers of Burundi provide a show where dance, songs, unbridled rhythms, humor and above all joie de vivre are mixed.&lt;/p&gt;
