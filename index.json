In less than ten years, livestock inventories declined by half, pulling down demand for feed grains, and the area planted to grains dropped by 25%.\nThe use of mineral fertilizer and other purchased inputs plummeted, driving yields down. Most farms could no longer afford to purchase new machinery and other capital investments. Following a nearly ten-year period of decline, Russian agriculture has experienced gradual ongoing improvement. The transition to a more market-oriented system has introduced an element of fiscal responsibility, which has resulted in increased efficiency as farmers try to maintain productivity while adjusting the resource constraints. The relatively smaller corporate farms and family farms that have emerged and grown stronger in the new market environment are now producing in aggregate value more than the total output of large corporate farms that first succeeded the traditional collectives.\nThe 2014 devaluation of the rouble and imposition of sanctions spurred domestic production, and in 2016 Russia exceeded Soviet grain production levels, and in that year became the world\u0026rsquo;s largest exporter of wheat.[2] In the last years Russia has emerged as a big agricultural power again,[3][4] despite also facing various challenges.[4]\nGeopolitical analyses of climate change adaptation foresee large opportunities for Russian agriculture during the rest of the 21st century as Siberia\u0026rsquo;s arability increases.[5] Managing migration flows, internal and international, is expected to be a central aspect of the process.[5]\n","date":1607889313,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607889313,"objectID":"0c399ee61d85e0386bfc0680157ba26e","permalink":"https://barutwanayo-syldie.github.io/project/mon-projet/","publishdate":"2020-12-13T22:55:13+03:00","relpermalink":"/project/mon-projet/","section":"project","summary":"Agriculture in Russia survived a severe transition decline in the early 1990s as it struggled to transform from a command economy to a market-oriented system.[1] Following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, large collective and state farms – the backbone of Soviet agriculture – had to contend with the sudden loss of state-guaranteed marketing and supply channels and a changing legal environment that created pressure for reorganization and restructuring.","tags":[],"title":"Agriculture in Russia","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Moscow expands the list of those who will soon be able to be vaccinated against coronavirus with the domestic drug Sputnik V. From December 28 it will include employees of the housing and utilities sector, catering and others. In addition, according to the mayor of the capital Sergey Sobyanin, vaccination points will also work during the New Year holidays.\n\u0026ldquo;COVID-19 vaccination points will be open during the New Year holidays. To allow as many Muscovites as possible to take advantage of free time and get vaccinated, starting Monday, December 28, 2020, we open an appointment for vaccination for new categories of city residents.\nThese are those employed in the areas of housing, public catering, sports and law enforcement, including police, prosecutors, courts and others,\u0026rdquo; - wrote the head of the city in his blog.\nHe noted that vaccination is also available for volunteers and those employed by nonprofit and religious organizations. \u0026ldquo;During the New Year and Christmas season, they have especially a lot of interaction with people. It will be good if they protect themselves in advance from the risk of getting covid,\u0026rdquo; the mayor believes.\nEarlier the mayor of Moscow expressed the hope that the vaccination will become more widespread and will be available in the coming weeks to all the inhabitants of the Russian capital. At present this free service is available to employees of education, health, culture and trade.\nIn addition, employees of the media, multifunctional centers of public services, social services, transport, energy and industry may get vaccinated upon request. Representatives of these sectors will receive an SMS-notification with an invitation to vaccination and instructions to sign up for the procedure.\nThe city authorities plan to vaccinate at least half of the city residents - 6-7 million people. It is also supposed to consider the issue of preferences for those who have already been vaccinated. The Mayor of Moscow has earlier pointed out that after vaccination the city\u0026rsquo;s inhabitants may return to life without restrictions.\nCoronavirus vaccination in the capital began earlier this month, on December 5. In 12 days, according to TASS, about 15 thousand people have been vaccinated. Registration for the procedure is done electronically - on the city portal mos.ru.\nIn addition, it is possible to sign up through the medical portal EMIAS. The registration is open six months in advance. In total there are 70 vaccination centers in Moscow, which are open daily from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.\nVaccination is allowed to those who have no symptoms of acute respiratory viral infections, who have not had coronavirus, and who are not ill during the procedure. In addition, vaccination is not recommended for pregnant women and people under 18 years of age.\nAt the same time, elderly patients will be able to undergo it in the near future. Earlier, the head of the Gamaleya Center Alexander Gintsburg, who developed the drug for vaccination, told about the results of the drug trial on older people.\n\u0026ldquo;The trial, in which a large sample of Moscow population aged over 60 years was involved, was completed a few days ago and today the scientific results of the test were summarized and presented to the Ministry of Health in the prescribed form \u0026ldquo;- said Gintsburg.\nHe emphasized that the results are good. \u0026ldquo;One can state with a certain degree of certainty that in the coming days a decision will be made on the possibility of using the Sputnik V vaccine to vaccinate the population starting from the age of 18 and without age restrictions,\u0026rdquo; Gintsburg believes.\nOne way or another, according to him, about 650 thousand doses of Sputnik V vaccine have already been released to civilian circulation. The same amount is still in the warehouses. He added that about 1.5 million people would be supplied with vaccine by the New Year.

It is a country where Agriculture employs 90% of the population. The objectives for the protection of the environment are essential and pass inevitably through education about the environment (ErE). We believe, however, that traditionally the people of Burundi had customs aimed at preserving its environment and that it was developing in this respect a certain number of values. It seems to us that it is essential revalorise traditional knowledge and practices in order to any action in EWE in Burundi. It is to be feared, indeed, that in contact with other cultures, certain elements of the Burundian culture have faded. It also seems that education on the environment can spread thanks to the action of the women who have a key role in the education of children and Burundi. Traditional Burundian education In ancient Burundi, children were educated for the function or position held by their parents. The blacksmith\u0026rsquo;s child became a blacksmith, the hunter\u0026rsquo;s child became a hunter. became a hunter. Mothers and fathers took care of the respectively of their boys and girls in order to teach them a trade.

For example, it was prescribed to respect forests and sacred animals and that by this obligation, the forests were preserved. The contact of the Burundian culture with other cultures With colonisation, traditional habits were abandoned in the taking advantage of modern practices. In parallel with a more or less tenacious traditionalism, there is a new trend towards synthesis between the existing culture and the new new influences, sometimes even towards an almost total abandonment of the ancestral heritage. (Manirambona, 1997, p. 11). Some research (e.g. Bigawa et al., 2000) concludes that that plants and animals once respected are no longer respected. Some species are threatened with extinction. Currently, the traditional way of conservation of biodiversity, which was achieved through the \u0026ldquo;in situ\u0026rdquo; existence of Sacred groves and sacred animals tend to disappear. A more rational mode of \u0026ldquo;ex-situ\u0026rdquo; conservation is manifested in the form of sacred woods, groves resources, genetic resources, agroforestry, and medicinal plants. in an enclosure. It seems urgent to us to revalorise certain practices or beliefs for the respect of the environment. We will take up here some examples of local practices for the protection of fauna and flora and the flora. The fauna Wildlife held a considerable place in Burundian culture. Some animals were highly respected for their beauty and their role in society. This is the case of the cow (inka). In addition to its dietary and medical role, it intervenes in the weaving and consolidation of family ties since it is a basis for the dowry at the wedding. Panthera leopard skin pardus serves as a costume for the dancers. Some birds (the ombrette or the Dominican widow, for example) as well as the leopard, the hare, the python, etc. were used in traditional medicine. Through education, mothers prohibited children from killing animals. For example, it was forbidden to kill the lizard. The Barundi used to say: Wishe umuserebanyi, nyoko aca acika amabere (if you kill the lizard, your mummy will lose the lizard) her breasts). Nobody dared to kill the widowed African wagtail for free, Motacilla aguimp. This one, like the sheep, represented God. (Imana). There were animals of good omen and others of bad omen. For example, our ancestors believed that the cry of an owl predicted the death of an ASPECTS OF CULTURAL HERITAGE CONTRIBUTING TO THE ERE AU BURUNDI 111 family member. However, a Rundi proverb says: Wica isake, ntiwica ico yabitse (you can kill the rooster, but you can\u0026rsquo;t kill what it predicted). This was a kind of ploy to avoid killing these people. animals that heralded unfortunate events. The Ox Heron, Bulbucus ibis - inyange, is praised for its beauty in songs and tales.

The Gitega Museum, created in 1955, is the guardian of Burundi\u0026rsquo;s past. Specimens of gourds, tools and objects used for daily work are present in this museum. It also keeps photographs of the last monarchs of the country as well as some traces left by colonization. It is an ethnological and photographic museum. The second museum is located in the capital Bujumbura, it is a living museum with reconstructions of royal huts. A herpetological research center is also stored there, a reptile reserve built within it has been growing since its opening in 1988.\nSome other monuments also attract the curious, the Belvedere of Bujumbura, for example, houses the mausoleum of Prince Louis Rwagasore, the main actor of national awareness. 10 km south of the capital, a stone was erected to recall the meeting of the scientist Livingstone and the young reporter Stanley in 1871. Various national parks make Burundi\u0026rsquo;s popularity worldwide, such as the Kibira Park and the Ruvubu Park. These parks allow not only to observe the animals of the African bush but in particular to evolve among them. The Kibira park even offers swimming in its thermal springs to be more in touch with nature. The fauna observed can range from antelopes to crocodiles, baboons and chimpanzees. Other monuments are just as amazing a few hours away from Bujumbura. The pyramid of Rotovu, for example, is built on the southernmost source of the Nile.\nThe open faults of Nyakazu as well as the Karera Falls, the second most important falls after those of Victoria, also offer a spectacle difficult to forget. Lake Tanganika is not to be omitted, classified as the most fishy lake in the world, its views from Vyanda are dazzling. Although the monuments are admirable, the popular heat will remain the best image of Burundi. A warm and friendly people who live to the rhythm of Ingomas with the drummers of Burundi provide a show where dance, songs, unbridled rhythms, humor and above all joie de vivre are mixed.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"e8f8d235e8e7f2efd912bfe865363fc3","permalink":"https://barutwanayo-syldie.github.io/project/example/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/example/","section":"project","summary":"An example of using the in-built project page.","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"What to see and what to do in Burundi","type":"project"},{"authors":["BARUTWANAYO  Syldie","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
